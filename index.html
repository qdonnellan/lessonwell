<p>Lesson is a lesson management platform that I built for the purpose of making my life as a Calculus teacher easier. It was originally a mercurial project hosted privately on Kiln - I've since decided to open source this project, change it to git, and move it here to GitHub.</p>

<a name="refactoring-in-progress" class="anchor" href="#refactoring-in-progress"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Refactoring in progress...</h3>

<p>I am currently in the process of refactoring the old code as much of it was written before I knew much about best practices (for example, there were no tests in the original project!). Since I use stripe for payment processing, I've not included any of my old mercurial commits in the move from Kiln-Github to protect my secret stripe-apis. </p>

<p>This transfer is a work in progress, check back for updates - I should probably be done sometime before march 2014</p>
