<section id="yourData">
	<h2>Your Data</h2>
	<h3>What personal data do you collect and why?</h3>
	<p>We collect the following personal data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name (optionally)</li>
		<li>E-mail address</li>
		<li>Google Account ID</li>
		<li>Google Account nickname</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your email address and other Google account information is provided to us when you link your Google Account with the lessonwell service. We use this information to identify your account, and to log you into our service. </p>
	<p>We do not collect your credit card information directly, nor do we store your credit card information on our servers.</p>
	<h3>Who can see my credit card number?</h3>
	<p>No one at lessonwell. We use the very trustworthy and secrure payment service <a href='https://stripe.com'>Stripe</a>. Read about Stripe's security policies <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">in their own words here</a></p>
	<p>When you go to change your subscription we may display the last four digits of your credit card number as an indication to you of which card we have on file. This information is provided directly from Stripe and is never stored on our servers.</p>
	<h3>Who can see my other personal information?</h3>
	<p>Your Name is shared through your personal profile and is made public to anyone who has the link to your profile. For this reason, you have the option to not provide us with your name.</p>				
	<p>Your Google Account ID, nickname, and email address are never given to anyone, ever, with one exception: we attach your email address to the transaction information we have on file with Stripe to identify payments you make with us. This is done so we can easily identify your payments.</p>
	<p>If you have purchased access to a course on lessonwell, your email address is attached to the transaction information of that purchase so that the teacher responsible for that course may have the option of contacting you with regards to payment information</p>
	<h3>Who can see the courses, units, and lessons I create?</h3>
	<p>Your content is immediately available to anyone with the appropriate link to that content unless you have selected the option to make the course Private. Private courses are only visible to users that have approved by you or have purchased access to the course after you have set an access price</p>
	<h3>Who can see my password?</h3>
	<p>Remember when you linked your account to Google? We are in no way affiliated with Google, except that we use your Google account to log you in (instead of gathering a separate password from you). We have no idea what your Google password is, and we never will. Google does not share your password with us, and we will never ask them to. <b>Any person or organization asking for your lessonwell password is acting fradulently, and is not us!</b></p>
	<p>We use the "Google login" service to ensure that your account is safe as determined by Google's very trustworthy security practices. <a href="http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/online-safety/security-tools/">Learn about your Google account security and privacy</a></p>
	<h3>How can I access my personal information?</h3>
	<p>From your profile page, select "Edit your account", and you should be able to see the personal information we have on file for you.</p>
	<h3>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h3>
	<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
	<h3>How are you protecting my data from hacker attacks?</h3>
	<p>lessonwell is a 'web application' which is deployed on servers operated by <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/training/intro/whatisgae#whatis">Google App Engine</a>. By running this platform on Google App Engine I can go to sleep at night knowing that the servers running my code are maintained by a top-notch organization. Without such a service this website would simply not exist. App Engine enables a small business (in our case, a <i>very</i> small business) to leverage the great security policies and infrastructures of the world-class organziation that is Google. Bottom-line: your data is really secure. Take a look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/whyappengine">Why App Engine</a> page to see a bit on why we chose this platform.</p>

	<h2>Document History</h2>
	<p>A huge, gracious, "thanks" to the folks at <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> who have wonderfully allowed the reuse of their Terms of Service which I have modified above. Creating a start-up from scratch, by myself, as a full-time teacher is a tall order - any bit of help is a boost and much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<pre>
1) 4 March 2013 - Draft Document Created
2) 14 April 2013 - Removed "Draft" from title. Added stuff about private courses and selling access
