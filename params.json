{"name":"Lessonwell","tagline":"a lesson management platform","body":"# lessonwell\r\n\r\nLesson is a lesson management platform that I built for the purpose of making my life as a Calculus teacher easier. It was originally a mercurial project hosted privately on Kiln - I've since decided to open source this project, change it to git, and move it here to GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Refactoring in progress...\r\nI am currently in the process of refactoring the old code as much of it was written before I knew much about best practices (for example, there were no tests in the original project!). Since I use stripe for payment processing, I've not included any of my old mercurial commits in the move from Kiln-Github to protect my secret stripe-apis. \r\n\r\nThis transfer is a work in progress, check back for updates - I should probably be done sometime before march 2014","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
